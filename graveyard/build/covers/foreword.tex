\huge NOTES FOR THE INTERPRETERS
\end{center}

\vspace*{1\baselineskip}

\begingroup
\textbf{General: \circled{1} Dynamics} in the \textbf{viola} and \textbf{accordion} correspond to \textbf{implement pressure} ( such as the fingers, the bellows, or the bow ). Dynamics in the \textbf{electric guitar} correspond to the \textbf{volume as controlled by a foot pedal}. \textbf{\circled{2}} After temporary \textbf{accidentals}, cancellation marks are printed also in the following measure ( for notes in the same octave ) and, in the same measure, for notes in other octaves, but they are printed again if the same note appears later in the same measure, except if the note is immediately repeated. \textbf{\circled{3}} Each interpreter reads \textbf{two staves}, where the \textbf{upper staff} corresponds to the actions of the \textbf{right hand}, and the \textbf{lower staff} corresponds to the actions of the \textbf{left hand}. If only one staff is present, the division of the hands is left to the interpreter's discretion. \textbf{\circled{4} Playing techniques} apply only to the note to which they are attached. If a technique is to persist for longer than a single note, a hooked, dashed line will span the music as long as the technique is active. \textbf{\circled{5} Dashed arrows above the staff} indicate a gradual transition from one technique or tempo to another. \textbf{\circled{6} Time signatures whose denominators are not a power of two} are to be understood as a type of metric modulation wherein the pulse shifts to a prolation indicated by the denominator. For example, \textbf{1/6} will contain one ``sixth" note, which is one-sixth of a whole note, or, a triplet quarter note. When these time signatures are active, tuplet brackets which are open on the right side similarly indicate the prolation of a note alone, rather than the number of beats in the prolation. \textbf{\circled{7} Blank measures} are to be understood as full-measure rests. \textbf{\circled{8} Flat glissandi} are sometimes used for the same function as ties.

\textbf{Scordatura: \circled{1} The electric guitar}'s \textbf{sixth string} should be tuned down a minor third to \textbf{C - sharp 3}. The \textbf{fifth string} should be tuned up a major third to \textbf{C - sharp 4}. The \textbf{fourth string} should be tuned up a major second to \textbf{E 4} at a ratio of \textbf{19/16} of the fifth string ( or, a \textbf{19-limit minor third} above the fifth string ). The \textbf{third string} should be tuned to \textbf{G 4} at a ratio of \textbf{32/27} of the fourth string ( or, a \textbf{Pythagorean minor third} above the fourth string ). The \textbf{second string} should be tuned down a minor second to \textbf{B 4} at a ratio of \textbf{81/64} of the third string ( or, a \textbf{Pythagorean major third} above the third string ). The \textbf{first string} should be tuned to \textbf{E 5} at a ratio of \textbf{11/8} of the second string ( or, the \textbf{11th partial} of the second string lowered one octave ). The tuning of the open strings represented with Helmholtz-Ellis accidentals coupled with the deviation in cents from the nearest “standard” accidental.
