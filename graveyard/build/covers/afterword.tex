\hspace{10mm} In the forests, fields, creeks, pastures, swamps, mountains, and bayous of the Southeastern United States, hidden dangers instill a caution towards the unseen. Among the unseen are concealed animals and hematophagous insects, heat which drenches the outside of the body while leaving the interior too dry to survive, and air of a thickness to drown in. It can be of no surprise, then, that in a region where such circumspection is required to survive its environment, its diversity of cultures and traditions so too would develop their own vigilance towards more speculative unseen forces. Haint - blue porch ceilings ward off spirits of the same name, broomsticks above doorposts compel boo - hags to count every bristle before entering a home, and glass bottles adorn the leafless limbs of young trees to entrap malevolent witches and shapeshifters.

\hspace{10mm} Many of the surviving reports on the collection and use of \textbf{graveyard dirt} describe it not as a defensive charm or ritual, but as a vessel of curses. Stories were told of, and accusations were made towards, deviant occultists gathering soil from a fresh grave with the intention of causing illness, famine, and misfortune by its power. These ``occultists," always members of ethnic, religious, and / or socioeconomic minority groups, were all but confirmed guilty at the moment of indictment, as though graveyard dirt was not acquired with hands beneath the midnight moon, but with the very accusation of its usage.

\hspace{10mm} Today, the malevolent unseens of the American Southeast are not found beneath indigo ceilings, nor counting grains of sand outside of cabin windows. Perhaps they never have been. For the most frightening forces have been found in the courthouses, in the sheriff's offices, and in the churches. These forces do not guard against spirits and hags, but against other human beings who they name as outsiders, pouring graveyard dirt onto their bodies with sigils far more dire than bristles, and weapons far more lethal than earth.
